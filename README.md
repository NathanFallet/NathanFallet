### Hey there, I'm Nathan

I started with some HTML projects (we all have to start with something), and then I worked a lot with PHP until I discovered Java and started making Minecraft Plugins for servers with friends.

When I was 14, I joined friends to make projects with them. Now, we are working as [Groupe MINASTE](https://github.com/GroupeMINASTE) on the web, creating website and apps for Android and iOS.

Check my amazing project list [here](https://www.nathanfallet.me)!
